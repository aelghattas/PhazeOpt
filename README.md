# PhazeOpt

`PhazeOpt` is a set of tools for Reservoir Fluid Charachterization.

This is a work in progress. So, any contribution or advice is welcomed and highly appreciated.

I'm using this project to:

* Deepen my understaning of Reservoir Fluid Charachterization
* Increase and enhance my Programing Skills
* Refurbish and enhance my understaning of Numerical Methods and Math in general

Ready tools for Testing:

1. `C7+` Charachterization using `Gamma` function

## `Gamma` Function
